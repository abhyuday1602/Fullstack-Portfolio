# Fullstack-Portfolio
A fullstack based porfolio website.

This website initially started to serve as a submition for the Free-Code-Camp Course.
Eventually though I took it seriously.

I started experimenting with stuff and learning new things.
Most of those actually aren't commited in this repo as I'm planning to make an advance react version of this.

The project being in fullstack made it preety comfortable for me to play with stuff that I never checked before.
The Figma design for the same is included in the repo as well.
